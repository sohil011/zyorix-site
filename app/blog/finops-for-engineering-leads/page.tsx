                <h2>Developer Velocity with Cost Guardrails</h2>
                <p>FinOps is not about restricting engineers; it's about empowering them. For Engineering Leads, the key is to balance speed with cost-efficiency. FinOps provides the tools to do this, such as cost guardrails that allow teams to innovate freely within safe spending limits. This autonomy increases developer velocity and ownership.</p>

                <h2>Tag Coverage, Budgets, and Anomalies</h2>
                <p>Good tagging hygiene is the foundation of FinOps. As an Engineering Lead, enforcing high tag coverage is crucial for cost visibility and allocation. Setting team-level budgets and anomaly alerts in a tool like AWS Cost Explorer gives your engineers the data they need to manage their own spend effectively, turning them into cost-conscious innovators.</p>

                <h2>IaC PR Hygiene and Golden Paths</h2>
                <p>Shift-left your cost management by integrating it into your development lifecycle. 'IaC PR hygiene' means checking the cost impact of infrastructure changes before they hit production. 'Golden paths' are pre-architected, cost-effective templates that your team can use to accelerate development without worrying about cost blowouts. These practices make cost a non-functional requirement, just like security and performance.</p>
