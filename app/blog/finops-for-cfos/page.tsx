                <h2>Unit Economics and Forecast Accuracy</h2>
                <p>For CFOs, the cloud's variable spend model can be a double-edged sword. FinOps provides the framework to master it. By focusing on unit economics (e.g., cost per customer, cost per transaction), you can tie cloud spend directly to business value. This granular view improves forecast accuracy and helps control budget variance, turning the cloud into a predictable driver of growth.</p>

                <h2>Showback/Chargeback and Variance Control</h2>
                <p>Implementing showback or chargeback models is a key FinOps capability. It fosters a culture of cost ownership among engineering teams. With clear visibility into who is spending what, you can effectively control variance and have meaningful conversations about cost-efficiency without stifling innovation.</p>

These are not just reports; they are decision-making tools that highlight trends, identify risks, and provide data-driven recommendations for action.</p>
